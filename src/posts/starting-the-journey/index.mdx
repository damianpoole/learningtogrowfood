First, let me get this out of the way, I've never grown anything in my life. Every plant I have bought, I have killed🪦in what feels like record time.

So with my non-green fingered nature out of the way, let us talk about what this blog is about. 👀

It has always been my dream to have an allotment, grow my own food, and be as self-sufficient as possible 🚜. I think I haven't done anything about it throughout the years due to being nervous, maybe even scared about failing. But as a much older man, I am more comfortable with failing. Can't say I'm ever happy about that, but we learn, and we move on.

So roll on April 2021, I move house 🏡. From Leeds to Aberfeldy in Scotland, only a mere 300 miles. What was remote working due to the pandemic has now become a full-time thing for me. So, no commutes
making me tired and stressed. I now have more time to dedicate to growing my own food 🥕🥦🍓. More importantly, I have more time to learn because, believe me, I have made all the beginner mistakes that
any YouTube 💻 top 10 would include.

My veg garden is well underway; I have already built two raised beds and planted 🧑‍🌾 quite a few crops. I will document this in more detail in future blog posts and go over the failures I have already had.

Hopefully, in the next week, I will have documented building my third raised bed and created a little guide for that.

Talk later 👋.
